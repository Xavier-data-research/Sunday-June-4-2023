The race mentality we have with AI is not that does not exist, but that the overall race is self-destruction.

Innovation happens over time to build these utopias, Industrial Revolution won’t equal the current time. We ultimately stopped building that infrastructure, 
especially in America innovation has not been powerful as it could have been but with the technology we have in today’s society
it can happen with more of an impact on human life our industries
don’t understand the correct direction of where we need to head vs where we are heading
